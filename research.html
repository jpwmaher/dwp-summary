                            <h3>Collaboration between DWP &amp; NHS</h3>

                            <p>Nothing can be achieved without first forming a partnership between DWP and NHS X, NHS England and NHS Digital. It’s important that all departments agree to help users get the support they need from DWP in a consent driven service.</p>
                            <br /><br />
                            <h3>Identity</h3>

                            <p>Citizens are happy to register and use NHS login as a way to securely access their medical information online, as they see it as a quicker way and wouldn’t require them to manually input information.</p>

                            <br /><br />

                            <h3>Consent</h3>

                            <p>Citizens are happy to consent to sharing their medical records online, as long as it is clear what they are consenting to.</p>

                            <br /><br />

                            <h3>Get medication information</h3>

                            <p>There is no set of criteria that is useful for DWP assessors and decision makers when thinking about medical/additional information. Currently it is subjective and often based on the experience and knowledge of the HCP.</p>

                            <br /><br />

                            <h3>Show/Share medical information</h3>

                            <p>Citizens want control over what is being shared with DWP by overseeing what information would be sent:<br />
                                - Most would share all as they feel they have “nothing to hide”.<br />
                                - Some users would share only what they thought was relevant, and happy to select just certain parts of their record.<br />
                                Citizens don’t want this information shared indefinitely and expected the agreement to share to be short term.</p>
                            <br /><br />

                            <h3>Further information</h3>

                            <p>Citizens don’t have security concerns around uploading further additional documents to their claim online. However, they are not keen on having to find and pay for this themselves or print it. Citizens are happier to select and share further documents that are preloaded to support their claim.</p>

                            <br /><br />

                            <h3>Mental Health Cafe Professionals</h3>

                            <p>MHCP’s currently have less direct contact with DWP concerning patients who claim health benefits. However, when shown an online prototype for further information requests, users reacted positively to this and could see it fitting into their workload, as long as the questions they were required to answer fit within their expertise</p>

                            <br /><br />

                            <h3>GPs</h3>

                            <p>GPs don’t feel they have as much of a personal relationship with patients anymore and are too time poor to fill out further information requested by DWP, especially when patient care is a priority.</p>
