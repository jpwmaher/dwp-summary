                            <p>To access this system DWP would need to engage with SCRa team. This service operates on a user consent based model for access to the SCR.</p>

                            <p>The NRL can help get access to mental healthcare plans that exist outside of primary care (GP’s and Hospitals) that may not have been shared.

                                To access this system DWP would need to complete an assessment. The assessment will look at a range of criteria including technical conformance, data protection, security, clinical safety, benefits measurement, business process review and updates and service operations.

                            <p>LHCR are regional health records and an establishing pattern in the health ecosystem. There are currently 7 trial errors establishing them and working to a joint standard.

                                The onboarding process is currently unknown as these are systems that are either in development or haven’t started yet.
