                            <p>We’ve spoken to Health Care Professionals and Decision Makers during to determine what data is useful to them in decision making. Our research has found that useful data is very subjective depending on the claimants condition and the particular benefit they’re claiming.</p>

                            <p>There is no one answer to what data is useful, this is proven out over the last 3 years of work carried out by DWP in the health space as well as our own research.</p>

                            <p>We have created a <a href="img/data-map.png">Data map</a> which shows what health information is available in each healthcare system. Some information is available in multiple systems. </p>
                            <p>It includes:</p>
                            <ul class="vertical menu overview-menu">
                                <li>Data reference, data item and description</li>
                                <li>Healthcare category</li>
                                <li>Healthcare system</li>
                                <li>System standard and format</li>
                                <li>National coverage</li>
                                <li>Accessibility</li>
                                <li>Owner</li>
                                <li>Information governance authority</li>
                            </ul>

                            <br />
                            <p>We believe that the data items highlighted in the technically possible section for the various systems are what are regarded as helpful data items for determining someone's eligibility for payment, referral to an assessment or disallowance.</p>

                            <p>Our recommended next steps to test this hypothesis are: </p>

                            <br />

                            <h3>A/B trial to understand what health information is useful to healthcare professionals</h3>

                            <p>A trial to measure what health information is most useful to assessors and others making a decision on a citizens ability to work.</p>
                            <p>A controlled A/B trial using the Summary Care Record application (SCRa). DWP would have 2 teams assessing the same citizens for 8 weeks. Team A have additional access to Summary Care Record application (SCRa), Team B use existing information only. </p>

                            <br /><br />

                            <h3>Quantitative card sorting to understand what health information is useful to healthcare professionals</h3>

                            <p>A quantitative card sorting test to quantify what health information is most useful to assessors and others making a decision on a citizens ability to work.</p>
                            <p>Roll out an electronic card sorting exercise for healthcare professionals to complete after each assessment. The exercise would take 5 to 10 minutes for each assessment, if scaled this would provide a quantitative sample of the most important health information.</p>

                            <br /><br />

                            <h3>Map available health information (data) to the descriptors</h3>

                            <p>A data mapping exercise to extend the completed data map to add how health information maps to the DWP descriptors</p>
                            <p>A mapping exercise to extend the healthcare data map to map each data field to a DWP descriptor. This will support more accurate prioritisation of any future technical integration work with healthcare systems </p>

                            <br /><br />

                            <h3>Redesign questions asked to citizens to meet changing health conditions</h3>

                            <p>Review the existing citizen facing forms, questions asked and information requested. </p>
                            <p>Redesigning the citizen facing forms to meet the changing citizen and health needs?</p>
